__Media__

Media files are regular objects that obey the same rules as other objects like text.

__History handled by Git__

Example: entering 6.004 recitation notes. I want to retain the fact that this information resulted from the particular recitation. A commit to the notes git repo would accomplish this, assuming mitigator understands how to search through the git history.

__Keybindings__

* Based on Emacs/Vim - I,j,k,l etc.
* User-defineable - JSON config file.

__Search__

* Incremental - Results start appearing immediately in a list.

_Shortcuts_

* Immediate - Hit a single key combo and then start typing. 
* Hitting enter at any time will go to the top result.
* Nav keys can be used to move through the list.
* Key in 0-9 will select the results in order.
