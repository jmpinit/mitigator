Types of Objects
----------------

* definition
* group
* link

Examples
========

What kind of object is an example? How does it relate to the concept that it is an example of?

_Answer:_ OOP philosophy provides a useful analogy. The Concept could be considered a class, and the Example an instantiation of that class.

Equivalence
===========

A term can have multiple equivalent definitions.

Literal Equivalence
-------------------

One-to-one.

1. `Noise immunity = Smaller of the low noise margin and the high noise margin. = (Voh - Vih)`
2. `Low noise margin = Vil - Vol` and `High noise margin = Voh - Vih`
3. Statement (1) can now be rendered as either its original, or as "Noise immunity = Smaller of Vil - Vol and Voh - Vih"

Syntax Equivalence
------------------

Based on some kind of substitutional function.

1. `min(x, y) = Smaller of x and y.`
2. Statement `Low noise margin = Smaller of the low noise margin and the high noise margin,` can now be rendered as `Low noise margin = min(low noise margin, high noise margin)`
